Domain Protection

Feb 10, 2023
Achieving email authenticity is part of an ongoing effort to protect users from phishing and improve the reputation of email sent from App State.
Campus email administrators have deployed email message authentication to provide campus units stronger control on preventing illegitimate use of @appstate email addresses.
Benefits
Reputation:
Protects the App State brand by preventing unauthenticated parties from sending email from our domain.
Visibility:
Reports increase visibility into our email program by letting us know who is sending email from the App State domain.
Security:
Establishes a consistent policy for dealing with messages that fail authentication and helps keep the campus email ecosystem more secure and trustworthy.
External Senders/Requests
Third-party email service providers (e.g. Mailchimp, Qualtrics, etc)
See our full list
.
We will continue to analyze reports of who is sending email on our behalf to correct any legitimate external email senders.
If you have a service not on this list or you have a new account with a service on this list,
submit an account assistance ticket at tech.appstate.edu
, or contact our help desk at x6266.

Duo - 2 Factor Authentication
Created by
Paula Ransom
, last modified by
Elle Smith
on
Jul 08, 2024
2FA
stands for
2-Factor Authentication
, meaning a system requires two separate forms of identity verification for access, making it virtually impossible for anyone to compromise your account without having both pieces of the puzzle.
2FA
secures your account against threats such as compromises caused by malware and phishing attacks. Even malicious actors who obtain your password will not be able to access your account.
2FA
works by combining your two factors:
What you know:
In our case, this is your App State username and password combination.
What you have:
This is the 2nd factor. It will take one of two forms:
the Duo mobile application on your smartphone,
a handy hardware token (also called a key or fob)
(
You will set this piece up
when you are ready to configure 2-Factor for your account
).
When both factors have been entered, you are granted access to the system.

Student PaperCut Print Articles
Created by
Paula Ransom
, last modified by
Elle Smith
on
Jun 05, 2024
There are four ways that students can print:
Mobility Print
Print from a Lab Computer
Print via Link
Print via Email
NOTE:
Only print via email has file limitations (a PDF or image file only).
All other forms of printing listed support the following file formats:
Microsoft Office® documents
Microsoft Outlook® files
PDF files
Images (JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP)
Text files (CSV, RTF & TXT)
Open Office documents
Google Docs & Sheets
3 Ways to Authenticate at the Printer
Print, make copies, and scan after you authenticate (identify yourself) at the printer in one of three ways:
AppCard swipe
Banner ID entry.
App State username and password entry.
PaperCut Pricing
Letter (8 1/2 x 11):
Black and White - $.10
Duplex (two-sided) - $.10
Color  - $.50
Any other sizes (ex: 11x14 or 11x17) - $2.00
Helpful Printing Tips
Make sure you are printing the correct document.
Be sure you print to the correct print queue:
ASU-STUDENT-PRINT-BW
for black & white printing
ASU-STUDENT-PRINT-COLOR
for color printing
Your card is debited as soon as you release the job to the printer. Once you have released the wrong document, there is no way to stop it from printing and debiting your card.
If you submit a document for printing and decide later that you no longer wish to print it, simply leave the document in the print queue. Any document left in the print queue longer than one hour will be deleted automatically.
How do I Pay
Print cards in the library will no longer be issued.
Money will need to be applied to your App Card in order to complete a print release.
To make a deposit (minimum $20) or check the balance on your App Card, visit
appcard.appstate.edu/appcard-online#deposits
.
At the University Campus store, you can add money in any amount.

Workshop Scheduler
Created by

Elle Smith
on
Jun 05, 2024
The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning for Student Success development team created the Workshop Scheduler online application to administer scheduling, promoting, and registering Appalachian users for group workshops:
http://workshops.appstate.edu
The Administrator Manual (
PDF
), which includes steps to create a community for facilitating workshops, instructions for using the application, and information about how to receive technical support for using the Workshop Scheduler, is being ported into the Appalachian Technology Knowledge Base and at the same time content is being updated for Version 2 which is in development.
Use the Administrator Manual for complete documentation for the current version. Version 2 was expected to release mid-Fall 2019.
